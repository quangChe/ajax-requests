# AJAX Mini Project

This is a mini project that I worked on as part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.
The project utilizes jQuery to run AJAX requests to Google Street View API, New York Times API, and Wikipedia API to provide a street view, news articles and Wikipedia articles related to the address that a user types in.

## How to Run the App

To view the app locally, download or clone this repository onto your local machine. Then, open the index.html file which will then open the app on our default browser.
